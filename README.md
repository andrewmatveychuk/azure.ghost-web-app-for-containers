A one-click [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) deployment on [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/).

## Deploy

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fandrewmatveychuk%2Fazure.ghost-web-app-for-containers%2Fmaster%2Fghost.json)

## Getting Started

This is an Azure Web app deployed as a container . It uses [the custom Ghost Docker image with Azure Application Insights support](https://github.com/andrewmatveychuk/docker-ghost-ai) and [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/) to store the application data.

The Azure Web app configuration is provided as a ready-to-use Bicep template that deploys and configures all required Azure resources:

* a VNet for private endpoints and internal app communication;
* a Web app for running the container;
* a Key Vault for storing secrets such as database passwords;
* a Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights component for monitoring the application;
* an Azure Database for MySQL server;
* an (optional) Front Door profile to secure and offload the traffic from the Web app .

All resources have their diagnostic settings configured to stream resource logs and metrics to the Log Analytics workspace.
